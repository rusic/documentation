# Terminology

Before you dive into things, you might want to have a look at our terminology guide. Since Rusic is still undergoing changes, the terminology has developed with it.

### Buckets and Spaces

Throughout the docs you'll come across `buckets` quite a lot this is just another word for a `space`, it's your little nook in the Rusic web. So when you're developing your theme or project, you'll be using the term `space` instead, but when working with the API here in the docs, you'll be using `bucket`. A `space` can essentially be thought of as a site, it's your own spot on the web.

### Themes

If you've ever used Wordpress before, you'll be able to pick up what a Rusic `theme` is rather quickly. It's the visual styling and architecture of your space or site. You can create your own from a blank theme, or you can use or even customise an existing Rusic theme.

To learn more about the file structure of themes checkout out the [File Structure](/themes/file-structure/) documentation.

### Templates

Rusic has a few different `templates`. When you download or create a blank Rusic theme, you're given various files such as the `layouts/subdomain.html`, your main template file, and `ideas/*.html.liquid` files. Within these templates you're given structured Liquid code to work with to develop your theme.

### Ideas

`Ideas` are simply an entry or post within your space, submitted by yourself or another user. If you had a gallery of photos, a photo could be considered an idea within your gallery (space), or a recipe within a cookbook.


### Participants and Users

The difference between `Participants` and a `User` can be a bit tricky at first. Anyone can be a `User`, these are just users who login to the Rusic space and interact with it (be that by creating/liking/commenting on an idea or something entirely different). A `Participant` can be any interactive user of the Rusic space, apart from the owner of the space.
