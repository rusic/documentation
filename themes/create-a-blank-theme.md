# Create a blank theme

Creating a new theme is easy once you have logged into Rusic just go to the Themes tab and click "New Theme" or go there directly with by [clicking here](https://rusic.com/themes/new).

You will be asked to give the space a name, and pick a starting point. If you are developing a theme locally it's usually best to start with a blank theme.
